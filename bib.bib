abstract = {The polarizable continuum model (PCM) is a computational method originally formulated 30 years ago but still today it represents one of the most successful examples among continuum solvation models. Such a success is mainly because of the continuous improvements, both in terms of computational efficiency and generality, made by all the people involved in the PCM project. The result of these efforts is that nowadays, PCM, with all its different variants, is the default choice in many computational codes to couple a quantum-mechanical (QM) description of a molecular system with a continuum description of the environment. In this review, a brief presentation of the main methodological and computational aspects of the method will be given together with an analysis of strengths and critical issues of its coupling with different QM methods. Finally, some examples of applications will be presented and discussed to show the potentialities of PCM in describing the effects of environments of increasing complexity. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The present work shows that integral equation methods may be used with success also for the latter cases, which are usually studied with three-dimensional methods, by far less competitive in terms of computational effort. We present the theoretical bases which underlie the method and some numerical tests which show both a complete equivalence with standard PCM versions for isotropic solvents, and a good efficiency for calculations with anisotropic dielectrics. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The conductor-like screening model COSMO, a variant of the dielectric continuum solvation models, has become very popular due to its algorithmic simplicity, numerical stability, and its great insensitivity with respect to outlying charge errors. The advanced model COSMO-RS, i.e., COSMO for realistic solvation, is a statistical thermodynamics theory based on COSMO polarization charge densities, which overcomes many of the limitations and theoretical shortcomings of dielectric continuum models. Due to its ability to treat mixtures at variable temperatures, it has become very popular in chemical engineering and in wide areas of physical and medicinal chemistry. COSMO-RS may currently be considered the most accurate model for the prediction of solvation energies. This article provides a short description of the basic concepts of both models, of the differences with other solvation models, and of their application areas. Finally, Direct-COSMO-RS, a recent direct integration of the COSMO-RS concept into quantum chemical calculations, is briefly described.

abstract = {Metadynamics is a powerful technique for enhancing sampling in molecular dynamics simulations and reconstructing the free-energy surface as a function of few selected degrees of freedom, often referred to as collective variables (CVs). In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have beenmade to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applica- tions in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set ofCVsand onthe possible strategies to allevi- ate this difficulty. Later in the second part,we present a few recent representative applications,which we have classified into three main classes: solid-state physics, chemical reactions, and biomolecules.},

The analysis is addressed to compare the relative importance of the various components of the dispersion energy (n = 6, 8, 10) and of the repulsion term, to compare several molecular indicators (molecular surface and volume, number of electrons) which may be put in relation to the dispersion-repulsion energy, and to define simplified computational strategies. The numerical examples refer to saturated hydrocarbons in water, treated with the homogeneous approximation of the distribution function which for this type of solution appears to be acceptable.},

abstract = {Simulating optical spectra in the condensed phase remains a challenge for theory due to the need to capture spectral signatures arising from anharmonicity and dynamical effects, such as vibronic progressions and asymmetry. As such, numerous simulation methods have been developed that invoke different approximations and vary in their ability to capture different physical regimes. Here, we use several models of chromophores in the condensed phase and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to rigorously assess the applicability of methods to simulate optical absorption spectra. Specifically, we focus on the ensemble scheme, which can address anharmonic potential energy surfaces but relies on the applicability of extreme nuclear-electronic time scale separation; the Franck-Condon method, which includes dynamical effects but generally only at the harmonic level; and the recently introduced ensemble zeroerature Franck-Condon approach, which straddles these limits. We also devote particular attention to the performance of methods derived from a cumulant expansion of the energy gap fluctuations and test the ability to approximate the requisite time correlation functions using classical dynamics with quantum correction factors. These results provide insights as to when these methods are applicable and able to capture the features of condensed phase spectra qualitatively and, in some cases, quantitatively across a range of regimes.},

abstract = {We report a static quantum chemistry modeling treatment to study how solvent molecules affect chemical reaction mechanisms without dynamics simulations. This modeling scheme uses a global optimization procedure to identify low energy intermediate states with different numbers of explicit solvent molecules and then the growing string method to locate sequential transition states along a reaction pathway. Testing this approach on the acid-catalyzed Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction in methanol, we found a reaction mechanism that is consistent with both recent experiments and computationally intensive dynamics simulations with explicit solvation. In doing so, we explain unphysical pitfalls that obfuscate computational modeling that uses microsolvated reaction intermediates. This new paramedic approach can promisingly capture essential physical chemistry of the complicated and multistep MBH reaction mechanism, and the energy profiles found with this model appear reasonably insensitive to the level of theory used for energy calculations. Thus, it should be a useful and computationally cost-effective approach for modeling solvent mediated reaction mechanisms when dynamics simulations are not possible.},

@article{Sunoj2012,
abstract = {Over the years, several methods have been developed to effectively represent the chemical behavior of solutes in solvents. The environmental effects arising due to solvation can generally be achieved either through inclusion of discrete solvent molecules or by inscribing into a cavity in a homogeneous and continuum dielectric medium. In both these approaches of computational origin, the perturbations on the solute induced by the surrounding solvent are at the focus of the problem. While the rigor and method of inclusion of solvent effects vary, such solvation models have found widespread applications, as evident from modern chemical literature. A hybrid method, commonly referred to as cluster-continuum model (CCM), brings together the key advantages of discrete and continuum models. In this perspective, we intend to highlight the latent potential of CCM toward obtaining accurate estimates on a number of properties as well as reactions of contemporary significance. The objective has generally been achieved by choosing illustrative examples from the literature, besides expending efforts to bring out the complementary advantages of CCM as compared to continuum or discrete solvation models. The majority of examples emanate from the prevalent applications of CCM to organic reactions, although a handful of interesting organometallic reactions have also been discussed. In addition, increasingly accurate computations of properties like pK a and solvation of ions obtained using the CCM protocol are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 the Owner Societies.},

abstract = {The rate constants and kinetic isotope effects for decarboxylation of 4-pyridylacetic acid depend strongly on whether the solvent is water or dioxane, and the present paper interprets this finding. We calculate the solvent dependence of the free energy barrier and of the 13C and 18 O kinetic isotope effects using a quantum mechanical solvation model based on class IV charges and semiempirical atomic surface tensions. The calculations provide a consistent interpretation of the experimental results, which provides a striking confirmation of the soundness of the solvation modeling. Even more significantly, the agreement of theory and experiment gives us confidence in the physical picture of the reaction provided by the model. This indicates that the location of the transition state, as measured by the length of the breaking C-C bond, is 0.24 {\AA} later than the gas phase in dioxane and 0.37 {\AA} later than the gas phase in water. Charge development at the transition state also depends strongly on the solvent; in particular the CO2 moiety is 0.07 electronic charge units more negative at the transition state in dioxane than in water.},

Geometries of the zwitterion and the transition state were optimized for the gas-phase reaction, for one model of reaction in aqueous solution in a previous study, and for five additional models of reaction in aqueous solution in the present study. The aqueous calculations include models in which one or two waters are treated explicitly, either without or with a surrounding continuum of bulk solvent; the latter is called a mixed discrete-continuum model. Bulk solvation effects are modeled both by solvation model SM5.42 and by a COSMO united atom solvation model; both of these models contain bulk electrostatics and short-range terms. Kinetic isotope effects were calculated by conventional transition state theory. We find that a discrete model of solvation with two explicit water molecules underestimates the free energy of activation for the decarboxylation reaction by at least 17 kcal/mol.},

abstract = {Hybrid discrete-continuum approaches for solvation have been widely applied for diverse problems in chemistry suck as pKa calculation in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, activation free energy barriers for ionic processes in solution, and surface reactions. A special version of this approach, the cluster-continuum quasichemical model, has also been used for establishing a single-ion solvation free energy scale in different solvents compatible with the tetraphenylarsonium tetraphenylborate assumption. The use of discrete-continuum solvation methods can lead to meaningful improvement with respect to pure continuum solvation models for modeling diverse chemical process in solution. In the case of pKa calculations, there are cases where the root mean squared error is as large as 7 pKa units with pure continuum solvation model and becomes around 1 pKa unit with the hybrid approach. For complex reactions in solution, errors as large as 10 kcal/mol for activation free energies with the pure continuum approach can be substantially reduced with the inclusion of explicit solvent molecules. A discussion of the theory of hybrid discrete-continuum methods is also presented and further development is expected in the coming years. This article is categorized under:.

Specifically, adQM/MM molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to characterize (1) the free energy profiles of halide exchange SN2 reactions in water, (2) the hydration structure of the Cl− ion, and (3) the solvation structure of the zwitterionic form of glycine in water. A comparison is made with the results obtained using standard MM and QM/MM methods as well as with the available fully QM and experimental data.

Adaptive QM/MM (quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical) methods repartition molecules on-the-fly into the QM and MM regions based on a partitioning criterion. A density-based parti-tioning scheme offers a unique way of carrying out QM and MM assignments on the presence/ absence of (non) covalent interactions between non-QM core molecules and the QM core. Here, we present two improvements to promote our density-based adaptive partitioning strategy for adaptive QM/MM calculations. First, bond formation/breaking processes between non-QM core molecules and the QM core are monitored using a density-based descriptor, to define an adaptive QM core region on the fly. Second, the density-based adaptive QM/MM partitioning scheme is made efficient enough for large systems by utilizating an adaptive search region and a Voronoi style-partitioning scheme. The adaptive search region is used to preselect the subset of molecules that may interact strongly enough with the QM core region, and then a density-based interaction calculation is only carried out on this subset. A Voronoi style-partitioning scheme achieves an effi-cient assignment of the density-based interactions.},

@article{Boselt2021,
abstract = {Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been developed to simulate molecular systems, where an explicit description of changes in the electronic structure is necessary. However, QM/MM MD simulations are computationally expensive compared to fully classical simulations as all valence electrons are treated explicitly and a self-consistent field (SCF) procedure is required. Recently, approaches have been proposed to replace the QM description with machine-learned (ML) models. However, condensed-phase systems pose a challenge for these approaches due to long-range interactions. Here, we establish a workflow, which incorporates the MM environment as an element type in a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP). The fitted HDNNP describes the potential-energy surface of the QM particles with an electrostatic embedding scheme. Thus, the MM particles feel a force from the polarized QM particles. To achieve chemical accuracy, we find that even simple systems require models with a strong gradient regularization, a large number of data points, and a substantial number of parameters. To address this issue, we extend our approach to a $\delta$-learning scheme, where the ML model learns the difference between a reference method (density functional theory (DFT)) and a cheaper semiempirical method (density functional tight binding (DFTB)). We show that such a scheme reaches the accuracy of the DFT reference method while requiring significantly less parameters. Furthermore, the $\delta$-learning scheme is capable of correctly incorporating long-range interactions within a cutoff of 1.4 nm. It is validated by performing MD simulations of retinoic acid in water and the interaction between S-adenoslymethioniat and cytosine in water. The presented results indicate that $\delta$-learning is a promising approach for (QM)ML/MM MD simulations of condensed-phase systems.},

The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging set of diverse molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets.

Here, we present a machine learning framework that enables the efficient development and validation of models for complex aqueous systems. Instead of trying to deliver a globally-optimal machine learning potential, we propose to develop models applicable to specific thermodynamic state points in a simple and user-friendly process. After an initial ab initio simulation, a machine learning potential is constructed with minimum human effort through a data-driven active learning protocol. Such models can afterwards be applied in exhaustive simulations to provide reliable answers for the scientific question at hand. We showcase this methodology on a diverse set of aqueous systems with increasing degrees of complexity. The systems chosen here comprise water with different ions in solution, water on a titanium dioxide surface, as well as water confined in nanotubes and between molybdenum disulfide sheets. Highlighting the accuracy of our approach compared to the ab initio reference, the resulting models are evaluated in detail with an automated validation protocol that includes structural and dynamical properties and the precision of the force prediction of the models. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach for the description of water on the rutile titanium dioxide (110) surface to analyze structure and mobility of water on this surface. Such machine learning models provide a straightforward and uncomplicated but accurate extension of simulation time and length scales for complex systems.},

abstract = {Many drug molecules contain biaryl fragments, resulting in a torsional barrier corresponding to rotation around the bond linking the aryls. The potential energy surfaces of these torsions vary significantly because of steric and electronic effects, ultimately affecting the relative stability of the molecular conformations in the protein-bound and solution states. Simulations of protein-ligand binding require accurate computational models to represent the intramolecular interactions to provide accurate predictions of the structure and dynamics of binding. In this article, we compare four force fields [generalized AMBER force field (GAFF), open force field (OpenFF), CHARMM general force field (CGenFF), optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS)] and two neural network potentials (ANI-2x and ANI-1ccx) for their ability to predict the torsional potential energy surfaces of 88 biaryls extracted from drug fragments. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) over the full potential energy surface and the mean absolute deviation of the torsion rotational barrier height (MADB) relative to high-level ab initio reference data (CCSD(T1)*) were used as the measure of accuracy. Uncertainties in these metrics due to the composition of the data set were estimated using bootstrap analysis. In comparison to high-level ab initio data, ANI-1ccx was most accurate for predicting the barrier height (rmsd: 0.5 ± 0.0 kcal/mol, MADB: 0.8 ± 0.1 kcal/mol), followed closely by ANI-2x (rmsd: 0.5 ± 0.0 kcal/mol, MADB: 1.0 ± 0.2 kcal/mol), then CGenFF (rmsd: 0.8 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, MADB: 1.3 ± 0.1 kcal/mol) and OpenFF (rmsd: 0.7 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, MADB: 1.3 ± 0.1 kcal/mol), then GAFF (rmsd: 1.2 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, MADB: 2.6 ± 0.5 kcal/mol), and finally OPLS (rmsd: 3.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol, MADB: 3.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol). Significantly, the neural network potentials (NNPs) are systematically more accurate and more reliable than any of the force fields. As a practical example, the NNP/molecular mechanics method was used to simulate the isomerization of ozanimod, a drug used for multiple sclerosis. Multinanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit aqueous solvent were performed, as well as umbrella sampling and adaptive biasing force-enhanced sampling techniques. The rate constant for this isomerization calculated using transition state theory was 4.30 × 10-1 ns-1, which is consistent with direct MD simulations.},

However, in their common formulation, mutual interactions between the quantum and classical parts are neglected. To go beyond such a picture, a polarizable embedding can be used. In this perspective, we focus on the induced point dipole formulation of polarizable QM/MM approaches and we show how efficient and linear scaling implementations have allowed their application to the modeling of complex biosystems. In particular, we discuss their use in the prediction of spectroscopies and in molecular dynamics simulations, including Born-Oppenheimer dynamics, enhanced sampling techniques and nonadiabatic descriptions. We finally suggest the theoretical and computational developments that still need to be achieved to overcome the limitations which have prevented so far larger diffusion of these methods.},

Although short-range solute-solvent interactions such as charge transfer, hydrogen bonding, and solute-solvent polarization can be taken into account with a quantum mechanical (QM) treatment of the solvent, it is unclear how much QM solvent is necessary to accurately model interactions with different solutes. In this work, we investigate the effect of explicit QM solvent on absorption spectra computed for a series of solutes with decreasing polarity. By adjusting the boundary between QM and classical molecular mechanical solvent to include up to 400 QM water molecules, convergence of the calculated absorption spectra with respect to the size of the QM region is achieved. We find that the rate of convergence does not correlate with solute polarity when excitation energies are calculated using time-dependent density functional theory with a range-separated hybrid functional, but it does correlate with solute polarity when using configuration interaction singles. We also find that larger basis sets converge the computed spectrum with fewer QM solvent molecules. To optimize the computational cost with respect to convergence, we test a mixed basis set with more basis functions for atoms of the chromophore and the solvent molecules that are nearest to it and fewer basis functions for the atoms of the remaining solvent molecules in the QM region. Our results show that using a mixed basis set is a potentially effective way to significantly lower the computational cost while reproducing the results computed with larger basis sets.},

abstract = {The study of chemical reactions in aqueous media is very important for its implications in several fields of science, from biology to industrial processes. However, modeling these reactions is difficult when water directly participates in the reaction, since it requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the system. Ab-initio molecular dynamics is the ideal candidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a high computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics simulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set of quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is difficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition state configurations. In this study we used an active learning procedure accelerated by enhanced sampling to harvest such structures and to build a neural-network potential to study the urea decomposition process in water. This allowed us to obtain the free energy profiles of this important reaction in a wide range of temperatures, to discover several novel metastable states, and improve the accuracy of the kinetic rates calculations. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the zwitterionic intermediate has the same probability of occurring via an acidic or a basic pathway, which could be the cause of the insensitivity of reaction rates to the solution pH.}

abstract = {In recent years, promising deep learning based interatomic potential energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently proposed ”on-the-fly” learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration, Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools, including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu using DP-GEN.

Here we describe DeePMD-kit, a package written in Python/C++ that has been designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning based representation of potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics. Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information contained in the original model.

abstract = {The nature of the bulk hydrated electron has been a challenge for both experiment and theory due to its short lifetime and high reactivity, and the need for a high-level of electronic structure theory to achieve predictive accuracy. The lack of a classical atomistic structural formula makes it exceedingly difficult to model the solvated electron using conventional empirical force fields, which describe the system in terms of interactions between point particles associated with atomic nuclei. Here we overcome this problem using a machine-learning model, that is sufficiently flexible to describe the effect of the excess electron on the structure of the surrounding water, without including the electron in the model explicitly. The resulting potential is not only able to reproduce the stable cavity structure but also recovers the correct localization dynamics that follow the injection of an electron in neat water. The machine learning model achieves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art correlated wave function method it is trained on. It is sufficiently inexpensive to afford a full quantum statistical and dynamical description and allows us to achieve accurate determination of the structure, diffusion mechanisms, and vibrational spectroscopy of the solvated electron.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI for short. ANI is a new method designed with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that utilize a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV) as a molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space, a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set.},

abstract = {The calculation of free-energy differences is one of the main challenges in computational biology and biochemistry. Umbrella sampling, biased molecular dynamics (MD), is one of the methods that provide free energy along a reaction coordinate. Here, the method is derived in a historic overview and is compared with related methods like thermodynamic integration, slow growth, steered MD, or the Jarzynski-based fast-growth technique. In umbrella sampling, bias potentials along a (one- or more-dimensional) reaction coordinate drive a system from one thermodynamic state to another (e.g., reactant and product). The intermediate steps are covered by a series of windows, at each of which an MD simulation is performed. The bias potentials can have any functional form. Often, harmonic potentials are used for their simplicity. From the sampled distribution of the system along the reaction coordinate, the change in free energy in each window can be calculated. The windows are then combined by methods like the weighted histogram analysis method or umbrella integration. If the bias potential is adapted to result in an even distribution between the end states, then this whole range can be spanned by one window (adaptive-bias umbrella sampling). In this case, the free-energy change is directly obtained from the bias. The sampling in each window can be improved by replica exchange methods; either by exchange between successive windows or by running additional simulations at higher temperatures.},

Simulations of the equilibrium density, radial distribution functions, self-diffusivity, the infrared spectrum, liquid dipole moments, and characterizations of the hydrogen bond network show that all three functionals have overcome the problem of the early AIMD simulations that erroneously found ambient water to be highly structured, but they differ substantially among themselves in agreement with experiment on this range of water properties. We show directly using water cluster data up through the pentamer that revPBE-D3 benefits from a cancellation of its intrinsic functional error by running classical trajectories, whereas the meta-GGA functionals are demonstrably more accurate and would require the simulation of nuclear quantum effects to realize better agreement with all cluster and condensed phase properties.},

It is based on iteratively ‘filling' the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches.},

The method bypasses the poor scaling with system size of standard replica exchange and thus reduces the number of replicas (parallel processes) that must be used. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST is compared with standard replica exchange for an alanine dipeptide molecule in water. The comparisons confirm that REST greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and increases the sampling efficiency. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water.},

abstract = {Herein, we present a novel Hamiltonian replica exchange protocol for classical molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding/unfolding. The scheme starts from the analysis of the energy-networks responsible for the stabilization of the folded conformation, by means of the energy-decomposition approach. In this framework, the compact energetic map of the native state is generated by a preliminary short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the protein in explicit solvent. This map is simplified by means of an eigenvalue decomposition. The highest components of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue indicate which sites, named "hot spots", are likely to be responsible for the stability and correct folding of the protein. In the Hamiltonian replica exchange protocol, we use modified force-field parameters to treat the interparticle non-bonded potentials of the hot spots within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to all other residues, as well as solvent-solvent interactions. We show that it is possible to reversibly simulate the folding/unfolding behavior of two test proteins, namely Villin HeadPiece HP35 (35 residues) and Protein A (62 residues), using a limited number of replicas. We next discuss possible implications for the study of folding mechanisms via all atom simulations.},

abstract = {Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST2) is a powerful sampling enhancement algorithm of molecular dynamics (MD) in that it needs significantly smaller number of replicas but achieves higher sampling efficiency relative to standard temperature exchange algorithm. In this paper, we extend the applicability of REST2 for quantitative biophysical simulations through a robust and generic implementation in greatly scalable MD software NAMD. The rescaling procedure of force field parameters controlling REST2 "hot region" is implemented into NAMD at the source code level. A user can conveniently select hot region through VMD and write the selection information into a PDB file. The rescaling keyword/parameter is written in NAMD Tcl script interface that enables an on-the-fly simulation parameter change. Our implementation of REST2 is within communication-enabled Tcl script built on top of Charm++, thus communication overhead of an exchange attempt is vanishingly small. Such a generic implementation facilitates seamless cooperation between REST2 and other modules of NAMD to provide enhanced sampling for complex biomolecular simulations. Three challenging applications including native REST2 simulation for peptide folding-unfolding transition, free energy perturbation/REST2 for absolute binding affinity of protein-ligand complex and umbrella sampling/REST2 Hamiltonian exchange for free energy landscape calculation were carried out on IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer to demonstrate efficacy of REST2 based on the present implementation.},

abstract = {Computational studies of organic systems are frequently limited to static pictures that closely align with textbook style presentations of reaction mechanisms and isomerization processes. Of course, in reality chemical systems are dynamic entities where a multitude of molecular conformations exists on incredibly complex potential energy surfaces (PES). Here, we borrow a computational technique originally conceived to be used in the context of biological simulations, together with empirical force fields, and apply it to organic chemical problems. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) permits thorough exploration of the PES. We combined REMD with density functional tight binding (DFTB), thereby establishing the level of accuracy necessary to analyze small molecular systems. Through the study of four prototypical problems: isomer identification, reaction mechanisms, temperature-dependent rotational processes, and catalysis, we reveal new insights and chemistry that likely would be missed using static electronic structure computations. The REMD-DFTB methodology at the heart of this study is powered by i-PI, which efficiently handles the interface between the DFTB and REMD codes. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We modify these unsupervised approaches, incorporating a supervised component following the same spirit as the principal covariates (PCov) regression method. We show how this results in selections that perform better in supervised tasks, demonstrating with models of increasing complexity, from ridge regression to kernel ridge regression and finally feed-forward neural networks. We also present adjustments to minimise the impact of any subselection when performing unsupervised tasks. We demonstrate the significant improvements associated with PCov-CUR and PCov-FPS selections for applications to chemistry and materials science, typically reducing by a factor of two the number of features and samples required to achieve a given level of regression accuracy.},

Even though recent developments have significantly reduced the overhead for modeling the quantum nature of the nuclei, the cost is still prohibitive when combined with advanced electronic structure methods. Here we present how multiple time step integrators can be combined with ring-polymer contraction techniques (effectively, multiple time stepping in imaginary time) to reduce virtually to zero the overhead of modelling nuclear quantum effects, while describing inter-atomic forces at high levels of electronic structure theory. This is demonstrated for a combination of MP2 and semi-local DFT applied to the Zundel cation. The approach can be seamlessly combined with other methods to reduce the computational cost of path integral calculations, such as high-order factorizations of the Boltzmann operator or generalized Langevin equation thermostats.},

Although the utility of these methods in systems where the interactions are described by empirical potentials is now well established, their application to ab initio molecular dynamics calculations has been limited by difficulties associated with splitting the ab initio potential into fast and slowly varying components. Here we present two schemes that enable efficient time-scale separation in ab initio calculations: one based on fragment decomposition and the other on range separation of the Coulomb operator in the electronic Hamiltonian. We demonstrate for both water clusters and a solvated hydroxide ion that multiple time-scale molecular dynamics allows for outer time steps of 2.5 fs, which are as large as those obtained when such schemes are applied to empirical potentials, while still allowing for bonds to be broken and reformed throughout the dynamics. This permits computational speedups of up to 4.4x, compared to standard Born-Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics with a 0.5 fs time step, while maintaining the same energy conservation and accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Considering the uncertainties associated with the experimental gas-phase free energies of ions that are required to use the cluster pair approximation as well as analyses of various subsets of data, we estimate an uncertainty for the absolute aqueous solvation free energy of the proton of no less than 2 kcal/mol. Using a value of -265.9 kcal/mol for the absolute aqueous solvation free energy of the proton, we expand and update our previous compilation of absolute aqueous solvation free energies; this new data set contains conventional and absolute aqueous solvation free energies for 121 unclustered ions (not including the proton) and 147 conventional and absolute aqueous solvation free energies for 51 clustered ions containing from 1 to 6 water molecules.

In contrast to most conventional potentials, which are based on physical approximations and simplifications to derive an analytic functional relation between the atomic configuration and the potential-energy, ML potentials rely on simple but very flexible mathematical terms without a direct physical meaning. Instead, in case of ML potentials the topology of the potential-energy surface is "learned" by adjusting a number of parameters with the aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible. Due to this bias-free construction, they are applicable to a wide range of systems without changes in their functional form, and a very high accuracy close to the underlying first-principles data can be obtained. Neural network potentials (NNPs), which have first been proposed about two decades ago, are an important class of ML potentials. Although the first NNPs have been restricted to small molecules with only a few degrees of freedom, they are now applicable to high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms, which enables addressing a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this tutorial review, the basic ideas of NNPs are presented with a special focus on developing NNPs for high-dimensional condensed systems.

While until recently the applicability of neural network potentials (NNPs) has been restricted to low-dimensional systems, this limitation has now been overcome and high-dimensional NNPs can be used in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of thousands of atoms. NNPs are constructed by adjusting a set of parameters using data from electronic structure calculations, and in many cases energies and forces can be obtained with very high accuracy. Therefore, NNP-based simulation results are often very close to those gained by a direct application of first-principles methods. In this review, the basic methodology of high-dimensional NNPs will be presented with a special focus on the scope and the remaining limitations of this approach. The development of NNPs requires substantial computational effort as typically thousands of reference calculations are required. Still, if the problem to be studied involves very large systems or long simulation times this overhead is regained quickly. Further, the method is still limited to systems containing about three or four chemical elements due to the rapidly increasing complexity of the configuration space, although many atoms of each species can be present. Due to the ability of NNPs to describe even extremely complex atomic configurations with excellent accuracy irrespective of the nature of the atomic interactions, they represent a general and therefore widely applicable technique, e.g. for addressing problems in materials science, for investigating properties of interfaces, and for studying solvation processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Once trained with electronic structure data, ML potentials can accelerate computer simulations by several orders of magnitude, while preserving quantum mechanical accuracy. This Review considers the methodology of an important class of ML potentials that employs artificial neural networks.},

@article{Lynch2001,
abstract = {We compare hybrid Hartree-Fock density-functional theory to ab initio approaches for locating saddle point geometries and calculating barrier heights on a Born-Oppenhiemer potential energy surface. We located reactant, product, and saddle point stationary points for 22 reactions by the MP2 and QCISD ab initio methods and the B3LYP, BH&HLYP, mPW1PW91, and MPW1K hybrid Hartree-Fock DFT methods. We examined all of these methods with two basis sets, 6-31+G(d,p) and MG3. By comparison to calculations on five systems where the saddle point has been optimized at a high level of theory, we determined that the best saddle point geometries were obtained using the MPW1K and QCISD levels of theory. Of the methods tested, mPW!PW91 and B3LYP are the least effective for determining saddle point geometries and have mean unsigned error in barrier heights of 3.4-4.2 kcal/mol, depending on the basis set. In contrast, the MPW1K level of theory predicts the most accurate saddle point geometries and has a mean unsigned error of only 1.5 kcal/mol for either basis set. For even better accuracy, the combination of MPWlK/6-31+G(d,p) geometry calculations with QCISD(T)/MG3 or CCSD(T)/MG3 single-point energy calculations is shown to have an excellent performance-to-cost ratio. As a side product of this work, we report optimized scale factors for computing zero point energies by MPW1K. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Cohen2001,
abstract = {The reliability of density functional theory (DFT) and many other electronic structure methods for molecular properties of molecules prone to artificial spatial symmetry breaking was assessed. For the diatomics (F2+, O2+, O2), comparison to experiment showed that HF and MP2 predictions are unreliable, while DFT and coupled-cluster predictions were found to be reasonable but with errors substantially larger than normal. Overall, the test cases indicate that DFT is not completely robust against unreliable property predictions.},

@article{Musil2021,
abstract = {The first step in the construction of a regression model or a data-driven analysis, aiming to predict or elucidate the relationship between the atomic-scale structure of matter and its properties, involves transforming the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms into a suitable representation. The development of atomic-scale representations has played, and continues to play, a central role in the success of machine-learning methods for chemistry and materials science. This review summarizes the current understanding of the nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical descriptions of atomistic structures, highlighting the deep underlying connections between different frameworks and the ideas that lead to computationally efficient and universally applicable models. It emphasizes the link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry, and their mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions and the most promising research directions in the field.},
